You are given some text potentially including sensible words. 
You should count how many words are included in the given text. 
A word should be whole and may be a part of other word. 
Text letter case does not matter. Words are given in lowercase and don't repeat. 
If a word appears several times in the text, it should be counted only once.

For example,
**text** - "*How* *are* sjfhdskfhskd *you*?", **words** - ("how", "are", "you", "hello").
The result will be 3.
