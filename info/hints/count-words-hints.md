## I have no idea how to start solving this mission
To check if a [string is included in an another string](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/expressions.html#in),
just use simple python construction:
```python
if word in text: # it's True if "word" is a substring of "text".
    something...
```

## I need some help to proceed with the mission

To iterate all words in a set:

```python
for word in word_set:
    do_something_with_it
```
## I am gone half way through. Need help!

Take a look at and gather the ideas from all the recent hints in one function and don't forget to return an integer.

```python
def count_words(text, words):
    result = 0
    for w in words:
        ...
    return result
```
